This project was solved the inverse kinematic problem for 2 degrees of freedom (rotation) by using an Artificial Neural Network. 
For the inverse kinematic problem by using ANN, I was implemented as below
1. We have to create or get a dataset for the training model. I was creating data, by the way, using for loop in Matlab.
2. And then, I upload data to google.colab website
3. I was trained with the dataset and obtained accuracy for 2dof is 98% .
4. Finally, I take a random data in test data to predict the position of a robot arm.
For more detail, you should view file 2dof.ipynb
